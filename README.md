# Stack-Overflow-Tag-Prediction
This project focusing on classifying questions asked on QnA forums, here we worked on 
Stack-Overflow(SO). Our main aim is to automatically classify a newly added question so 
that it can be assign it to some active user who have good rating for answering similar 
question on same topics.
For this purpose I have used various Machine Learning(ML) models and will try to predict the 
tag of a question.
